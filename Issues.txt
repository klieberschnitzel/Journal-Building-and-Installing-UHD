Because I get the "send buffer could not be resized sufficiently" error I configure
/etc/sysctl.conf

net.core.rmem_max=24266666
net.core.wmem_max=24266666

/etc/sysctl.conf is suppose to execute everytime I boot up but it looks like something 
overrides this configuration because I still get the write (send buffer) error as shown below:

After opening up a terminal, i need to run 
sudo sysctl -p 

--I shouldn't have to.
What's write over the net.core.wmen_max setting after sysctl.conf runs?
